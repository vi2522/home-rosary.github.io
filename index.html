                <h3>Come, Holy Spirit</h3>
                <p>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit and they shall be created. And You shall renew the face of the earth.

                O, God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit, did instruct the hearts of the faithful, grant that by the same Holy Spirit we may be truly wise and ever enjoy His consolations, Through Christ Our Lord, Amen.</p>

                <h3>The Apostles' Creed</h3>
                <p>I believe in God,
                    the Father Almighty,
                    Creator of heaven and earth,
                    and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
                    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
                    born of the Virgin Mary,
                    suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                    was crucified, died and was buried;
                    He descended into hell;
                    on the third day He rose again from the dead;
                    He ascended into heaven,
                    and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
                    from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
                    I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                    the Holy Catholic Church,
                    the communion of Saints,
                    the forgiveness of sins,
                    the resurrection of the body,
                    and life everlasting.
                    
                    
                    Amen.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Our Father</h3>
                <p>Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Three Hail Marys</h3>
                <p>Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee.
                    Blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.
                    Holy Mary Mother of God,
                    pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death
                    Amen.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Glory Be to the Father</h3>
                <p>Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>
